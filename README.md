# README

I was able to successfully integrate bootstrap into a new Rails 8 project using the instructions found in this [document](
https://dev.to/jessalejo/create-a-new-rails-72-project-with-bootstrap-theme-on-a-newly-set-up-wsl-in-minutes-4p6#:~:text=Create%20a%20New%20Rails%20Project%201%20Application%20Structure%3A,esbuild%20%28-j%3Desbuild%29%3A%20Configures%20esbuild%20as%20the%20JavaScript%20bundler. )

Some additional steps to cleanup my ***WSL*** environment
* uninstall npm 
* uninstall node
* uninstall yarn

```
sudo apt-get remove yarn && sudo apt-get purge yarn
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt autoremove
```

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks are collections of pre-written CSS files and sometimes JavaScript components that offer reusable code for common design elements. They provide a set of predefined classes and rules, streamlining the development process by offering a foundation of reusable CSS styles for common elements such as buttons, grids, forms, and navigation menus.
